Owner wants a dashboard where she can track how well Discount Mart is doing for this year (in terms of Sales, Profit and Quantity Sold).

She would also like to know how well categories are performing as well as different regions. 

She assumes that most customers buy 2 or more products per basket/order but would like this confirmed by the data. 

She also noted that Profit is 30% of the selling price.
